# CSC115-Intro-to-Python
I took this class in the Spring of 2024 where I learned the basics of Python Programming through PyCharm and apply my skills in a midterm & final project. <br/>
Midterm Project: Organism Population (while, for, if-else loops) <br/>
Final Project: Menu Program with different coding structures and outcomes (random number generation, slicing, information extraction, random choice)
